    the seafood. Vibrant colors and enticing aromas create a feast for 
    the senses. </p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat up your fish stock (or vegetable broth) in its own pot. 
        Then you will cook the mussels separately from the risotto in a 
        stockpot of white wine and garlic.</li>
    <li>While you wait for the mussels to steam, you can start sauteing 
        the garlic and white onion with olive oil in a large pot, such as 
        a Dutch oven pot. Once the mussels finish cooking (when the shell opens), 
        keep a few mussels in the shell and shuck the rest. Set all the mussels aside.</li>
    <li>Once the white onion is translucent add the risotto and lightly toast the kernels for 3 
        - 5 minutes. Deglaze the pot with white wine and lemon juice and stir occasionally until 
        the risotto absorbs all the liquid. Then mix the tomato paste and water together and add into 
        the risotto till it absorbs the liquid again. Slowly add a ladle of hot broth into the risotto 
        and continuously stir until the risotto absorbs all of the broth. At this time, you will want 
        to start a timer for 18 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once 18 minutes have passed, add the shucked mussels, prawns, baby scallops, and baby squid to 
        the risotto. Continue the process of adding broth and stirring continuously for another 7 minutes 
        or until the risotto is cooked to perfection â€“ tender yet firm to the bite.</li>

    <li>Add grated parmesan cheese to the risotto to make it extra creamy and delicious. Season to taste with 
        salt and pepper. Then garnish with chopped flat-leaf parsley and the mussels in the shell. Serve and enjoy!</li>
