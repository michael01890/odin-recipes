<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds pork belly</li>
    <li>6 slices of ginger</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>3 scallions</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Shaoxing wine</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoonsdark soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>2 star anise</li>
    <li>4 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1-2 dried chili peppers</li>
    <li>4 cups water</li>
  
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The first step is to blanch the pork belly, which removes any blood or impurities from the meat. 
        To do this, add the pork belly and 3 slices of ginger to a pot with enough cold water to submerge 
        the pork belly. With the lid on, bring it to a boil. Once the pot boils, turn down the heat and 
        simmer for one more minute. Drain, rinse the pork belly clean, and set aside.</li>

    <li>With the wok set over low heat, add the oil and rock sugar (or 3 tablespoons regular sugar). Slowly 
        melt the sugar, taking care to not let it burn. Then add in the pork belly, 3 slices ginger, and the 
        white parts of the scallions. Turn up the heat to medium. Stir and coat the pork belly with the melted sugar.</li>

    <li>Now, add the Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, cinnamon, star anise, bay leaves, dried chili peppers, 
        and water. Stir and make sure everything is submerged. There will be some caramelized sugar on your spatula, dissolve 
        it in the water before covering the wok. Bring the mixture up to a simmer over medium low heat for 1 hour. Check the 
        pork periodically to make sure the sauce doesn’t dry up.</li>

    <li>Once the pork is to your liking in terms of tenderness, turn up the heat to cook off any excess sauce, stirring constantly. 
        The sauce will reduce to a glistening coating on the pork belly. Last, add in the remaining ½ teaspoon sugar and the green 
        parts of the scallions. Stir quickly and serve!</li>
